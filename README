**Descripton**

basemap - plot on map projections (with coastlines and political boundaries)
using matplotlib.

**Requirements**

python 2.5 (or higher)

matplotlib

numpy 

The GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source) library (version 3.1.1 or higher).
Source code is included in the geos-3.3.3 directory.

PIL (http://pythonware.com/products/pil) is optional (only
needed for Basemap warpimage and bluemarble methods).

On linux, if your python was installed via a package management system, make
sure the corresponding "python-dev" package is also installed.  Otherwise, you
may not have the python header (Python.h), which is required to build python
C extensions.

**Documentation** 

see http://matplotlib.github.com/basemap/

see scripts in 'examples' directory for example usage.

read the FAQ and/or email the matplotlib-users mailing list if 
you have problems or questions.

**Install**

0) Install pre-requisite python modules numpy and matplotlib.

1) Then download basemap-X.Y.Z.tar.gz (approx 100 mb) from
the sourceforge download site, unpack and cd to basemap-X.Y.Z.

2) Install the GEOS library.  If you already have it on your
system, just set the environment variable GEOS_DIR to point to the location 
of libgeos_c and geos_c.h (if libgeos_c is in /usr/local/lib and
geos_c.h is in /usr/local/include, set GEOS_DIR to /usr/local).
Then go to step (3).  If you don't have it, you can build it from
the source code included with basemap by following these steps:

 > cd geos-3.3.3
 > export GEOS_DIR=<where you want the libs and headers to go>
   A reasonable choice on a Unix-like system is /usr/local, or
   if you don't have permission to write there, your home directory.
 > ./configure --prefix=$GEOS_DIR 
 > make; make install

3) cd back to the top level basemap directory (basemap-X.Y.Z) and
run the usual 'python setup.py install'.  Check your installation
by running "from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap" at the python
prompt.

4) To test, cd to the examples directory and run 'python simpletest.py'.
To run all the examples (except those that have extra dependencies
or require an internet connection), execute 'python run_all.py'.

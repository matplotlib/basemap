GEOS TODO:

- Feed PrecisionModel to OverlayResultValidator to set _TOLERANCE

- Test unit tests for snapround package

- DoubleBits misregards BYTE_ENDIAN, must check it.

- BUILD CORRECTNESS:
	- include <geos/config.h> from all .cpp files

- WKB tester in doc/examples.cpp should do point-by-point comparison.

- Implement Safe's idea of a compile-time enabled 2d-only
  inlineable CoordinateSequence

- WKB extension with LINEARRING ?

- Check how to disable GEOS_VERSION define on command line
  (or make GEOS_VERSION define in version.h optional)
  not a major problems, just makes the compiler issue some warninigs.

- Check GeometryEditor behaviour (modify passed geom or create a new one ?)
  [not documented]

- Add distinct binary predicates test support in XMLTester

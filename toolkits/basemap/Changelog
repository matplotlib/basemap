20050331:  version 0.1.2 - now can handle negative longitudes (patch
           from Michael Brady). basemap.interp can now handle irregular
           (but still rectilinear) lat/lon grids.
20050203:  version 0.1 released on SF.
20050202:  Changed LineCollections.color to set_color in a try/except block.
           (color was a typo in 0.71 and is deprecated).
20050130:  no user visible changes.  Uses new pyrex generated
           C extension interface to proj.4 which is twice as
           fast as the Thuban one.
20050124:  some code reorg, fixed bugs in S. Hem. projections.
           xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax Basemap instance variables renamed
           to llcrnrx,urcrnrx,llcrnry,urcrnry. Added __call__
           and makegrid methods to Basemap class.
20050121:  proj.4 is now called via a C-library interface, instead
           of using the proj command-line tool via os.popen.
20050119:  fixed glitches in drawing of parallels and meridians.

Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area Projection
=======================================

An equal-area projection. The green shapes drawn on the map are equal-area
circles on the surface of the earth.  Known as "Tissot's indicatrix",
they can be used to show the angular and areal distortion of a map projection.
On a conformal projection, the shape of the circles is preserved, but the
area is not.  On a equal-area projection, the area is preserved but the 
shape is not.

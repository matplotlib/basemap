Oblique Mercator Projection
===========================

The oblique aspect of the mercator projection.
The projection centerline, instead of being a latitude (as in
the regular mercator projection) or a longitude (as in the
transverse mercator projection) can be an 
arbitrary great circle (defined by specifying two points).
